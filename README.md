For this portion of the game, I decided to split the JavaScript code that executes the game play into an external file.  I find that it's easier to read and maintain as a separate file.

Reflection question: Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.

Answer: Within ttt5, I focused on making my JavaScript more efficient / elegant.  I worked on understanding the forEach method as well as the conditional statement using the ternary operation.  I feel good about logically working through a problem and being able to find a way to execute the code to the requirements.  However, I am still working towards more efficient construction and use of arrow functions.  I inserted an arrow function in ttt5 but it was a simpler use of it.
